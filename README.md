## Backend Features

- **API Endpoints:** Define API endpoints to handle various operations, such as tours listing, user authentication, booking management, and handling contact form submissions.

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to allow users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features.

- **Database Integration:** Integrate MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store data related to tours, user profiles, bookings, and contact inquiries.

- **Express Middleware:** Utilize Express middleware for tasks such as handling CORS, parsing request bodies, and logging.

- **CRUD Operations:** Set up CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage tour data, user profiles, and contact form entries.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling middleware to provide appropriate responses for various types of errors.

- **Search Functionality:** Implement search functionality to help users find specific tours based on various criteria, such as location, category, and price range.

- **Authentication Middleware:** Create middleware to protect certain routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access specific resources.

- **Authorization:** Set up authorization to control access to certain routes and features based on user roles.

- **Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure that incoming data meets the required format and criteria.

- **Contact Form Handling:** Handle contact form submissions from users and store the inquiries in the database for later review.

- **Error Logging:** Implement logging mechanisms to track and log errors and server activities for monitoring and debugging.

- **Deployment:** Prepare the backend server for deployment to a hosting service, ensuring it is secure and performant in a production environment.

These backend features work in conjunction with the frontend to provide a seamless and fully functional Tours & Travels web application.

## What I Learned

- Backend Development: I embarked on my first full-stack journey, transitioning from frontend development to working with the backend. I gained hands-on experience in building the server-side of the application.

- Express.js: I learned how to set up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and define API routes for various functionalities.

- MongoDB Integration: I successfully integrated MongoDB as the backend database to store and retrieve tour and contact data.

- API Calls and Controllers: I worked on creating API routes and defining controllers to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tours and contacts.

- Environment Variables: I learned to use environment variables to store sensitive information like database connection URI and secret keys securely.

- Deployment: I gained knowledge of deploying the backend server to make the application accessible online. I configured the production environment, managed dependencies, and ensured security with HTTPS and authentication.

- Error Handling: I implemented error handling techniques to provide meaningful responses to users in case of errors or invalid requests.

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): I set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process, ensuring smooth and efficient updates to the application.

- Version Control: I practiced version control for the backend codebase, enabling me to collaborate effectively and roll back changes if needed.

Overall, building the backend of the TravelWorld app taught me valuable skills in server-side development, database integration, and deployment, making me a more well-rounded full-stack developer. I now have the confidence to handle complex backend tasks and work on complete web applications with a blend of frontend and backend expertise.
